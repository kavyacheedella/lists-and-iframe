    <h3>WEBSITE</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A website is a collection of web pages and related content that is
             identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. 
             It is typically accessible via the Internet or a private local area network (LAN) 
             using a web browser. Websites can serve various purposes, such as providing information, 
             entertainment, commerce, communication, or interaction with users. They may contain text,
             images, videos, hyperlinks, forms, and other multimedia elements to convey information 
             or facilitate user interaction. Websites can range from simple static pages 
            to complex dynamic web applications with interactive features and databases.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>WEB APPLICATION</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A web application is a software program that users interact 
            with through a web browser over the internet. It's different from a static website because 
            it can perform various functions like processing data, storing information, or allowing users
             to interact with it in different ways, such as filling out forms, uploading files, or 
             conducting transactions. Examples of web applications include email services 
            like Gmail, social media platforms like Facebook, and online shopping websites like Amazon.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>LIBRARY</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Library is a collection of pre-written code modules, functions, or classes that developers 
            can use to perform specific tasks or solve common problems. These libraries are designed 
            to be reusable and often focus on providing functionality for specific areas of development.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>FRAMEWORK</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In web development a framework is a pre-established collection of libraries, tools, and
             conventions that provide a structured foundation for building web applications.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>HTML is a Markup Language</b>
        </li>
        <br>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                 <b>Hypertext:</b> "Hypertext" refers to text displayed on a computer or other electronic
                 device with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately
                 access. These hyperlinks can lead to different sections of the same document, 
                 other documents, or entirely different websites. The concept of hypertext is 
                 central to HTML, as it allows for the creation of interconnected documents and 
                 is fundamental to the structure of the web..
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Markup:</b> A set of rules that defines how the layout and content should be displayed 
                in the browser. It focuses on the presentation and structure of content. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                <b>Creating Webpages:</b>HTML is primarily used to create and design webpages.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Website Skeleton: </b>It acts as the skeleton of a website, providing the basic
                 structure.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Elements and Tags: </b>HTML is made up of elements represented by tags, which tell 
                   the browser what to display and how to display it.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>KEY CONCEPTS:</h3>

    <h3>Summary</h3><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>HTML </b>is the foundational language for creating web pages.</li><br>
        <li>It uses <b>tags</b> and <b>elements</b> to define the structure and content</li><br>
        <li>The language has evolved significantly since its inception, with HTML5 being the 
              current standard, offering enhanced capabilities for modern web development.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common HTML Tags</h3>
    <h3>Heading tags in html</h3>
    <p>Heading tags in HTML are used to define headings or titles for sections of 
        content on a webpage. They range from h1 to h6, with h1 being the largest and most 
        important heading, and h6 being the smallest and least important.
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><b>h1:</b> Largest heading</li><br>
        <li><b>h2:</b> Second largest heading</li><br>
	    <li><b>h3:</b> Third largest heading</li><br>
	    <li><b>h4: </b>Fouth largest heading</li><br>
	    <li><b>h5:</b> fifth largest or second smallest heading </li><br>
	    <li><b>h6:</b> Smallest heading</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h3>HTML tags are classified :</h3>
    <ol start="3">
        <li><b>Paired Tags or Container tags:</b>Paired tags have both opening and closing tags,
             and they enclose content between them. 
             For example, and in the above example.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>Self-Closing Tags or Empty tags or Void tags:</b> Self-closing tags do not 
            have a separate closing tag, and they are used to insert elements that do not
             contain any content or do not require closing. For example, 
            for an image element, or br tag for a line break.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>Html list tags</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Unordered list</li>
        <li>Ordered list</li>
        <li>Description list</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Unordered List </h4>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Creates a list of items without any specific order.</li><br>
        <li>Attributes:</li><br>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>type: </b>Specifies the bullet style. Values can be "disc" (default), "circle", 
                or "square".
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Ordered List:</h4>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Used to create a list of items In specific order</li><br>
        <li>Attributes:</li><br>
        <ul type="disc">
             <li><b>type:</b> Specifies the numbering style. Values can be "1" (default, decimal),
                 "A" (uppercase letters), "a" (lowercase letters), "I" (uppercase Roman numerals), 
                 "i" (lowercase Roman numerals).</li><br>
             <li><b>start: </b>Specifies the starting value of the first item.</li><br>
            <li><b>reversed: </b>Reverses the numbering order</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Display behaviors</h3>
    <h4>Block-Level Elements:</h4>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Elements that start on a new line and take up the full width available.</li><br>
        <li>Examples: <b>div, p, h1-h6, ul, ol, li</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Inline Elements:</h4>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.</li><br>
        <li>Examples: <b>span, a, img, strong, em</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Break tag</h4>
    <p>Break tag in HTML is used to insert a single line break within the text content of an HTML document.
       This is the first line of text.<br>This is the second line of text.
    </p>
    <h4>Hr tag</h4>
    <p>The <b>hr</b> tag in HTML is used to create a horizontal rule, also known as a
         horizontal line or divider, within the content of an HTML document.
         It is a self-closing tag. When the browser renders the HTML, it displays a
         horizontal line across the width of its containing element, typically to visually 
         separate sections of content.
    </p>
    <h4>Pre tag</h4>
    <p>The pre tag in HTML stands for "preformatted text". It is used to display text exactly 
        as it appears in the HTML code, preserving both spaces and line breaks. This tag is 
        particularly useful for displaying code snippets, ASCII art, or any text where maintaining
        the original formatting is important.
    </p>
    <h3><u>Path:</u></h3>
    <p>path specifies the location of a resource on the web server. It follows the domain 
        name and precedes any query parameters or fragment identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>https://www.example.com/folder/subfolder/file.html</p>
    <p>In this example, the path is "/folder/subfolder/file.html", which indicates the location 
        of the file "file.html" within the "subfolder" of the "folder" directory on the server.
    </p>
    <h3>Absolute Paths</h3>
    <p>An absolute path is a complete URL that includes the protocol (e.g., http:// or https://), 
        domain name, and the full path to the resource. It provides the exact location of 
        a resource on the web.
    </p>
    <p>Example: <a href="https://www.example.com/folder/subfolder/file.html">https://www.example.com/folder/subfolder/file.html</a></p>
    <h3>Advantages of Absolute Paths:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Consistency: </b>Always points to the same resource, regardless of the current page's location.</li><br>
        <li><b>External Resources: </b>Useful for linking to external resources or when the resource is hosted on a different domain.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Disadvantages of Absolute Paths:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Maintenance: </b>If the domain or structure changes, all absolute links need to be updated.</li><br>
        <li><b>Long URLs: </b>Can result in longer URLs, making them less readable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Relative Paths</h3>
    <p>A relative path is a URL that specifies the location of a resource in relation to the current page's location. 
        It does not include the domain name or protocol, making it shorter and more flexible.
    </p>
    <p>Example: <a href="subfolder/file.html">subfolder/file.html</a></p>
    <h3>Advantages of Relative Paths:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Flexibility: </b>Automatically adjusts if the current page is moved to a different directory.</li><br>
        <li><b>Shorter URLs: </b>More concise and easier to read.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Disadvantages of Relative Paths:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Context-Dependent: </b>Depends on the current page's location, which can lead to broken links if the structure changes.</li><br>
        <li><b>Limited to Same Domain: </b>Cannot be used to link to resources on different domains.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Anchor tags</h3>
    <ul type="disc"><li>Anchor tags in HTML are used to create hyperlinks that allow users to navigate from one page to another or to a specific section within the same page. 
        The anchor tag is represented by the <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> element, and it typically includes an <b>href</b> attribute that specifies the URL or target of the link.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
    </p>
    <p>In this example, clicking on the link will take the user to "https://www.example.com".</p>
    <p>Anchor tags can also be used to link to specific sections within the same page
    by using fragment identifiers. A fragment identifier is a part of the URL that starts with a hash symbol (#) and refers to an element with a matching id attribute on the page.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
        <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
    </p>
    <p>In this example, clicking the link will scroll the page to the element with the id "section1".
